    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>300g coffee ice cream</li>
      <li>300g vanilla ice cream</li>
      <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil, for the tin</li>
      <li>300g dark chocolate, roughly chopped</li>
      <li>50g coconut oil</li>
      <li>50g honeycomb or Maltesers, crushed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Leave the ice creams out at room temperature for a few mins to soften
        slightly. Brush a 1.2-litre loaf tin with the vegetable oil and line
        with cling film. Put 250g dark chocolate and the coconut oil in a small
        heatproof bowl over a pan of just simmering water. Stir to melt, then
        set aside to cool.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spoon half the coffee ice cream into the base of the tin and level the
        surface. Working quickly, spread over a quarter of the chocolate sauce,
        then half the vanilla ice cream and another quarter of chocolate sauce.
        Repeat with the remaining chocolate sauce and ice creams, finishing with
        a layer of chocolate sauce. Cover loosely with cling film and freeze for
        at least 2 hrs, or ideally overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt the remaining 50g chocolate in a heatproof bowl over a pan of
        simmering water. Lift the terrine out of the tin and turn out onto a
        plate. Drizzle with the melted chocolate and top with the crushed
        honeycomb or Maltesers. Cut into thick slices to serve.
      </li>
